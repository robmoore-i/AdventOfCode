# Advent of Code 2018

1: Q (plus scan)

2: Q (string parsing)

3: Q (square overlaps on grid)

4: Q (timestamps)

5: Q (string searching and inline deletion)

6: Q (manhattan distance)

7: Q (topological sort)

8: Python (trees)

9: Python (circular doubly linked lists)

10. Q (ASCII moving stars)

11. Clojure (Kernel sums on a grid [part 1 only])

On day 11 I came off the bench again so unfortunately I can't be doing AoC
outside of weekends and after work. Hope this can help fellow Q-ists.
